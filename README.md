This app works as a day planner which will save and load saved "plans" from local storage. It also color codes the time blocks to indicate current, past, and present hour. This app was interesting to make. The first challenge was realize that I needed to convert my times to military time in order to be able to color code my blocks. I also was challenged with learning how to use $(this) a ton and how helpful that it can be.
